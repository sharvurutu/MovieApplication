# Movie Cruiser App - The Starter Code

The Movie Cruiser app helps you search movies over the Internet and save your favorite movies in a watchlist. The Movie app is built using the following Tech Stack:
- Angular.io + Bootstrap as the Front end
- Java + Spring Boot as the Backend
- MySQL as a data store

You can familiarize yourself with the working app through the following set of [screenshots and instructions.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ggbzCo04QSb8obLSJp7OtiQFlwgirgUnElHp-ERKC50)

This source code of this app is not complete and need some functionaility to be implemented as described in [ PROBLEM.md ](/PROBLEM.md) in this repository. 


## Pre-requisites  
1. Git  
2. Angular.io (v4 > ), with Angular CLI (v1.3 >)  
3. Bootstrap 4  
4. Open JDK v8  
5. Spring Boot  
6. Maven v3.3  
7. MySQL 5.7  
8. HTML 5 supported browser needed  
9. Source code editors (Sublime Text, Eclipse(STS))  

To start working using the source code provided, you first need to download the code in your machine.
Download the source code by running the following command:

```git clone https://gitlab-dev.stackroute.in/<yourusername>/movie-cruiser.git```

Once the above repository (refer to the repository structure given below) is cloned on your local machine, perform the following steps to configure the same on your machine.


## Setting up the project in your machine

1. Ensure you have MySQL Server installed and running on your machine (MySQL is already set up in your VMs with username:root and passowrd:root123)
2. Create a schema ( with no tables ) in MySQL to be used by this application along with a user account through which our application can connect to that schema (table and data will be generated as you run the application).  
3. Update ```env-variables.sh```(for Ubuntu)/```env-variables.ps1```(for Windows) with the schema name, username, password you created in Step 2 for MySQL.  
4. To start the backend, open terminal from root directory and run following commands in same terminal -  
    a. For Ubuntu - `. ./env-variables.sh` and Windows - `env-variables.ps1` (in Powershell) to set necessary the environment variables as these would be required in your backend server application code  
    b. `mvn package`  
    c. `npm run spring-boot:run`  
5. This application is fetching data from `The Movie Database API` (https://api.themoviedb.org/3). You need to register for an API key here and update property `tmdbApiKey` of the Angular [ Search service ](/src/app/services/search.service.ts). To get the API key -  
	a. Sign up [ here ](https://www.themoviedb.org/)  
	b. Follow [ instructions ](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)  
6. To start the frontend, open a new terminal from root directory and run following commands -  
    a. `npm install`  
    b. `npm run start`  

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the running application which should look as shown in the [screenshots](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ggbzCo04QSb8obLSJp7OtiQFlwgirgUnElHp-ERKC50) shared above as well.
